Myrath (Arabic: ميراث ‎ - "Legacy") is a Tunisian progressive oriental metal band formed Metal Multilingual Tunisian Interesting take on a slightly stale genre, clean vocals with a noticeable Arabic tinge. Not the most insane technical highs but enjoyable to listen to. Would recommend more for fans of less face-melty metal but also has interesting elements for those who are (like myself.)

I was thinking about buying some music tonight, namely CDs because Itunes sucks for artist compensation and the albums I want aren't on Bandcamp. I used to pirate music all the time, but I got rid of all the stuff I don't own. Now I am much more selective about which bands I actually listen to. The albums I was thinking of buying are Myrath's Tales of the Sands (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5d4ql9IaBo) and Legacy (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXCrHzRUdaM).
