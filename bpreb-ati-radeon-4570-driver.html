                            <p>TL;DR - Computer died while I was AFK, noticed a bad smell, wasn't PSU, wasn't RAM, began to function after removing my GPU, but now my CPU runs way too hot. Tried reseating my CPU, still hot. Hello all. This is my first time posting on these forums after using the countless resources here for troubleshooting my PC over the years. I never thought I would have to be making my own thread with my specific problem that I could not solve on my own. Yesterday, I started my day like any other Hello there, When closing the lid of my MBP, expecting it to go to sleep, I find the machine has re-started 50amp#37; of the time. I have reset SMC several times, this seems to have no effect. This is a 2017 15" MBPtb. This has been fairly consistent since purchasing the machine a bit over a year ago. Here is the latest kernel panic summary: Tue Jul 3 14:37:30 2018 \ \ \ Panic Report \ \ \ panic(cpu 2 caller 0xffffff7f8a9c9063): "displayModeDidChange failed: Failed to reserve I’ve never been able to get both GPU's mining at the same time (newbie here). When I search for the GPU’s in Ubuntu command line they both appear: 01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD/ATI Device 67ef (rev e5) 03:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD/ATI Device 699f (rev c7) I've tried switching them back and forth between the PCI and the display port and they both work. And since they are both appearing when searching in the comman. Hi r/techsupport, I was wondering if someone could help. I'm considering buying a new graphics card, but wanted to check if this sounds like the right step in light of the below symptoms and steps I've taken so far. Many thanks. My PC crashes when I play some games e.g. Overwatch and Depth. It never crashes when I play CS:GO. It never crashes in normal day-to-day use. When I boot Overwatch and Depth, sometimes it crashes straight away but sometimes I can play a few games before it does. 
Hi This is NOT a question about performace to play the game, I have more than enough. This IS a question about, why on earth I get less FPS with a much better GPU compared to my old one. Old GPU: Radeon HD7870 New GPU: GTX 970 I used the FPS Benchmark Map: Old GPU 1024 all low: 380 FPS New GPU 1024 all low: 320 FPS I set the Nvidia power thingy to performance. I used DDU to get rid of my ATI Drivers before I installed the Nvidia, everything should be clean and fresh. Windows Status: RESOLVED Computer Type: Desktop GPU: MSI Radeon R9 280X GAMING 3G, GDDR5 3GB, not overclocked, no SLI/Crossfire CPU: Intel Core i5 4570 Motherboard: MSI B85-G41 PC Mate RAM: Crucial Ballistix Tactical BLT2C4G3D1608ET3LX0CEU 2x4GB PSU: Seasonic M12II 620W Operating System amp Version: Windows 10 GPU Drivers: Catalyst 15.11 beta (later drivers are the problem) Chipset Drivers: Intel(R) B85 LPC Controller - 8C50 Background Applications: N.A. Description of Problem: Specs: Windows 10 pro 64-bit CPU: Intel core i5 4570@3.20 GHZ RAM: 8.00 GB Dual-Channel DDR3 @ 666Mhz Motherboard: MSI H81M-p33 Graphics: G215HV/ 3072 MB ATI Radeon R9 200 series Storage: 931GB Western Digital Optical Drives: HL-DT-ST DVD+-RW GH50N Audio: Realtek High definition Audio Okay so my computer keeps crashing every time I tried to do something video related, I can browse the internet but if i want to watch a video it may randomly crash, the same goes for playing games it just crashes. I've searched all over the internet and havn't found a fix that works. Any help would be appreciated as the game is pretty much unplayable. Intel Core 2 Duo CPU 2.3Ghz 4096MB RAM Windows 7 64-bit ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4570 I bought the game on Steam. I've checked my drivers are up to date. I have defragmented and verified the game cache. All other games, including newer ones like Skyrim, display no similiar error. Any other info needed. (/solved) So i have the vaio vgn-nw21mf/w. Running Windows 7. It has the Ati Mobility Radeon HD 4570 , which isnt officialy supported by AMD. So it tells me to just get drivers from sony, but they havent updated the drivers available at all. Installing Drivers directly from AMD wont work, it will install CCC and everything else, but the option to install drivers wont show up at all in the install menu. I also tried a tool called mobility modder, but it really didnt work. Im kinda puzzeld. ###Troubleshooting Help: Not sure what to do because I've never had an issue like this before. I have a computer that's been working fine for the last couple years, made a few replacements throughout that time and never had an issue before. First thought is to take it to a shop but its Sunday and I'm not sure how much they'd charge or how long they'd keep it. The issue is that after I installed my R9 290 I installed the new drivers, reset the computer to to apply them and Windows would 
Hello , I'm littledemy , a.k.a as henryhotmail. As the title metions , I can't get sfm to start. Whenever I start sfm , steam tells me I am in the app , but nothing appears , but after some looking in the taskmanager , I found the sfm.exe process . It closes 1-2-3 minutes afterwards and steam tells me I am no longer in the sfm app. I tried to launch hammerpoint , it works , as expected. Model Viewer and Face Poser do not work , the error message I get is "FATAL ERROR Unable I am having a problem with games crashing, Games load up fine, but the sound when using the hdmi on the graphics card is all distorted and fuzzy, which gets worse the longer I play, then after an hour or so on BioShock infinite, and sooner on Dota2 the game will crash and the error states that direct 11 has crashed or 'Display driver stopped responding and has recovered' If I plug speakers in to the motherboard there are no sound problems but the games still crash. I am playing Bioshock infini. Hello all, not sure if this is the right place to ask but here goes. My brother and I have identical laptop PCs running windows 7 64bit, ATI Mobility Radeon 4570, and Intel 2.4 dual cores. We both have screen flickering issues while trying to play an old PC game called Star Miner Special Edition (This game originally came from a CD called Egames gallaxy of games red edition). We got the game working by using compatibility settings and downloading something called d3drm.DLL the game's folder. </p>
